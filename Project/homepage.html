		<p>Since March, the Philippines has been put under an unending lockdown to combat the spread of COVID-19. In places where there are less cases, more freedom is given to the people, but the premise remains the same. Although children and elderly are technically allowed to go outside now, it's not a good idea to have everybody outside at once.</p>
	
		<p>So are we supposed to stay indoors the whole day? Unfortunately yes. To minimize cases, people are advised to only go outside when necessary. The issue with staying indoors for such a prolonged period of time is that people start going insane since most of their daily routine was abolished and because of the lack of fresh scenery. It's also much worse on students and workers, where days are spent in front of the computer because it's a necessity to survive. The excuse of <i>"You're at home, you should have an easier time"</i> doesn't work because in response to that more work is given, nullifying the effect, and possibly making online work harder.</p>
	
		<p>There are also a lot of different factors of our life that we took for granted until the quarantine began. We're missing the time chatting with friends, celebrating special days outside, even the commute for some people. The pandemic has taken a toll on everybody, physically or mentally. So I made this webpage to help people find how to live during the modern plague, prioritizing your mental health over the mountains of work to be done. With a healthy mind you won't be easily as overwhelmed from working and studying, giving you more resilency to finish faster, thus giving you more time to yourself.</p>
