		<p>"As higher education adapts to teaching and learning at a distance, the workload and the learning load of adopting a new delivery mode is taking a huge toll on the lives of those in higher education. This is an immense problem that is growing rapidly. While there are some students who are thriving through online learning, the toll of the virus, isolation, increased workloads and other associated effects are rising among many students, staff and faculty members. It must not be underestimated..."</p>
		
		<p>"Faculty members are feeling the huge stress of remaking their classes into effective digital forms. The additional workload and concomitant anxiety are heaped upon the already multifaceted responsibilities of faculty. The added load has heightened the concerns over faculty burnout. So many faculty members who already live on the edge of burnout in meeting the teaching, advising, research and publication expectations are facing an emotional letdown or even collapse.</p>
		
		<p>Most students are feeling the strain. For many, that strain begins with the eyes. Those unaccustomed to squinting at poorly adjusted computer screens in suboptimum ambient lighting are subjected to eyestrain that can have lasting effects. Ophthalmologists recommend taking breaks from screen reading every 20 minutes and adjusting room lighting to avoid glare and reflections." (Schroeder, 2020)</p>

	<p>Online classes have been tough for both the faculty and the students, especially for prestigious schools such as Pisay. Unfortunately, according to some people, the Guidance Office, who strive to maintain the mental health of the students, were unresponsive to the students' plea to give a break.</p>
	
	<p>Take my advice with a grain of salt (since I'm also a crammer), but here are some ways to help survive online classes:</p>

			<li><p>The "Pomodoro technique" helps increase productivity by decreasing distractions and helps efficiently focus. The schedule is to work	 for 25 minutes, take a short break, repeat four times. On the fourth time, take a longer break. (Wikipedia)</p></li>
			<li><p>Make small goals. There's no need to finish literally every single requirement within the next hour. Especially with projects, make deadlines for yourself so you know when you need to finish it.</p></li> <!-- NOTE TO SELF: Follow what you preach -->
			<li><p>Don't multitask. The human brain can only handle one task at a time, so finish your current task and start on the next.</p></li>
			<li><p>Set your priorities straight. If you have an urgent task due tomorrow, do that first. If you have some time to spare, feel free to finish the easier tasks first.</p></li>
			<li><p>Take a break from the computer. After online classes are finished for the day, your eyes would get tired. So take your eyes off the computer (or phone) and do something that does not involve digital screens. Read a book, print out the questions and answer sheets, or simply nap. Quality over quantity.(Paterson, 2020)</p></li>
